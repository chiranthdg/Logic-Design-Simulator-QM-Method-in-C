# Logic-Design-Simulator-QM-Method-in-C
This is a project to implement QM Method for minmization of boolean functions using imiplicants
• Automating the logic design process using C language whose time efficiency is much better to conventional methods(Manual K-Maps).
• It uses the concept of Linked Lists to form multiple list groupings based on different priorities and finds the necessary logic
design by removing the redundancy.
